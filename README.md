## 📚 Publications
### 6th International Conference on Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCCT 2024)
**Rajasthan Institute of Engineering and Technology, Jaipur, India**

**A 3D CNN MODEL WITH MULTI-FEATURE FUSION FOR ENHANCING HUMAN EMOTION RECOGNITION FROM SPEECH** (Jan. 2024)

- Developed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Classifier to effectively identify emotions from microphone-captured speech data.
- Our proposed model incorporating an adopted 3D CNN and multi-feature fusion demonstrates superior accuracy than state-of-the-art models for human emotion recognition from speech. The proposed model uses MFCC, CS, and MeS features that form a 3D tensor for nuanced emotional cue analysis.
- Our 3D CNN model introduces a novel approach by incorporating three distinct feature extraction techniques—namely, MFCC, chroma shift, and mel-spectrogram—which are then stacked along the Z-axis, forming the third dimension of our model.
